<head>: Contains metadata about the webpage.

2. CSS Styling (style.css)
The CSS file is responsible for the visual styling of the webpage. Hereâ€™s an explanation of the major styles used:

General Styles:

* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }: Resets default margins and padding, ensuring consistent spacing.
html, body { height: 100%; width: 100%; }: Makes the page occupy the full height and width of the screen.
font-family: Sets the default fonts for text on the page.
Grid Layout (#main):

The layout is divided into three columns and three rows using grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.
grid-template-columns: 25% 25% 50%;: Creates three columns with the last column taking up 50% of the width.
grid-template-rows: 30% 55% 15%;: Defines row heights for content distribution.
Decorative Square (#square):

height: 25px; width: 25px; rotate: 45deg;: Creates a small square rotated by 45 degrees to appear like a diamond.
background-color: black;: The square is black.
Navigation Menu (#left-top-right):

text-align: right;: Aligns the text to the right.
Hides certain elements (like h6 and h5) based on screen size using media queries.
h4, h5, h6: Defines font sizes and spacing for different headings in the menu.
Main Heading Section (#left-center):

The large headings (h1) have a font size of 6vw, ensuring they scale with the width of the viewport.
The nth-child(2n) selector centers the even-numbered headings.
Text Block (#left-bottom):

The paragraph (p) is styled with a small font size (9px) and a light gray color (#666).
Video Section (#right):

object-fit: cover;: Ensures the video scales without distortion.
The video has a border-radius: 10%, giving it rounded corners.
Arrow Button (#arrow):

Positioned at the center of the page using position: absolute and transformed for visual effect.
The arrow is styled with a bright orange background (orangered) and rounded (border-radius: 30%).
The icon inside (i) is scaled using font-size: 50px.

3. Responsive Design
The design is responsive, adapting to smaller screens using media queries (@media (max-width: 600px)).
On smaller screens, elements like the headings (h1) become larger, and the layout changes to a simpler grid structure.
Some elements, like menu options and text, are hidden or rearranged to better fit mobile devices.
